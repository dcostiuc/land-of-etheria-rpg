# The Land of Etheria
An early passion project heavily inspired by games such as AdventureQuest.

What started out as a sandbox for ideas and experimentation evolved into a  
text-based Python 3 Role-Playing game, practicing object-oriented principles learned in high school.

_Stay tuned for `Land of Etheria 2`, a reworked, redesigned, expanded graphical version of the original,   
being implemented in `C++` and the `SFML` library._

### Things that weren't done at the time of development that should be:
* Code modularization (splitting out game code into corresponding/related files)
* Better documentation
* Trying out some design patterns
* Better managmenent of in-game entities/items
