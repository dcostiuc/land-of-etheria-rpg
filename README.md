# The Land of Etheria

An early passion project heavily inspired by games such as AdventureQuest.

What started out as a sandbox for ideas and experimentation evolved into a text-based Python 3 Role-Playing game,  
also practicing object-oriented principles learned in high school.

## Features

- Several `NPC`s to interact with
- Numerous `Enemies` to battle
- Multiple `Bosses` to challenge
- Many `Items` (including `Weapons`, `Armor`, `Potions` and more) to collect, equip, and use
- An inventory and trading system
- Turn-Based `Battle` system
- `Game` management system/lifecycle
- A `Rarity` system
- An `Effects` system

### Tech Debt:

- Better documentation
- Trying out some design patterns
- Better management of in-game entities/items
- General refactoring
