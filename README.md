# The Land of Etheria
An early attempt at a text-based Python 3 RPG game practicing `Object-Oriented Principles` learned in high school.

### Things that weren't done at the time of development that should be:
* Code modularization (splitting out game code into corresponding/related files)
* Better documentation
* Trying out some design patterns
* Better managmenent of in-game entities/items (i.e. not just making all of them at global scope)
