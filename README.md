# The Land of Etheria
An early passion project heavily inspired by games such as AdventureQuest.

What started out as a sandbox for ideas and experimentation evolved into a  
text-based Python 3 Role-Playing game, practicing object-oriented principles learned in high school.

_Stay tuned for `Land of Etheria 2`, a reworked, redesigned, expanded graphical version of the original,   
being implemented in `C++` and the `SFML` library._

## Features
* Several `NPC`s to interact with
* Numerous `Enemies` to battle
* Multiple `Bosses` to challenge
* Many `Items` (including `Weapons`, `Armor`, `Potions` and more) to collect, equip, and use
* An inventory and trading system
* Turn-Based `Battle` system
* `Game` management system/lifecycle
* A `Rarity` system
* An `Effects` system

### Things that weren't done at the time of development that should be:
* Code modularization (splitting out game code into logical folders & files)
* Better documentation
* Trying out some design patterns
* Better management of in-game entities/items
